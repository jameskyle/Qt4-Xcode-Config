A simple script that first runs qmake with the -spec macx-xcode switch, then
populates the generated Xcode project with build options specified in the
xcode.yaml file. An example file is provided.

There's a top level 'pbxproj' field with a few settings. These are settings
found on the project wide level usually found in the 'General' tab of the Project
Info.

Each top level key after that specifies a project build target.

The script does not yet create targets that don't exist, so currently you'll
only use 'Debug' and 'Release' which are created by the qmake generator.

1. Edit the xcode.yaml file with your preferred settings for different targets
2. Put both xcode.yaml and qxc_config.py in your Qt4 project directory
3. Run ./qxc_config.py
