A simple script that first runs qmake with the -spec macx-xcode switch, then
populates the generated Xcode project with build options specified in the
xcode.yaml file. An example file is provided.

1. Edit the xcode.yaml file with your preferred settings for different targets
2. Put both xcode.yaml and qxc_config.py in your Qt4 project directory
3. Run ./qxc_config.py
